- Lucide icons (recommended)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Review [`analysis.md`](analysis.md) for current gaps
2. Check [`priority-matrix.md`](priority-matrix.md) for planning
3. Start with Phase 1: [`phase1-foundation.md`](phase1-foundation.md)
4. Track progress in [`completion-checklist.md`](completion-checklist.md)

## 📝 Notes

- **Grid System** is the foundation - implement first
- **Theme System** must support MUI/Ant Design level customization
- **Accessibility** is non-negotiable for production use
- **Testing** prevents regressions - aim for 80%+ coverage
- **Documentation** enables adoption - maintain Storybook stories
