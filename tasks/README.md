# 📋 Preact Components System - Development Tasks

This directory contains modular, LLM-session-sized tasks for improving the Preact Components System codebase. Each task is designed to be completed in 1-3 hours and focuses on specific improvements.

## 📁 Task Organization

Tasks are numbered and prioritized:

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Complete First)

- `01-missing-test-files.md` - Create comprehensive test suites
- `02-eslint-configuration.md` - Set up linting and code quality
- `03-typescript-improvements.md` - Fix type safety issues

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Complete Next)

- `04-box-performance-optimization.md` - Optimize Box component performance
- `05-component-standardization.md` - Standardize component patterns
- `06-component-documentation.md` - Add comprehensive documentation
- `07-accessibility-improvements.md` - Enhance accessibility
- `08-hook-architecture-optimization.md` - Optimize hook usage
- `09-test-pattern-standardization.md` - Standardize testing patterns

## 🎯 Task Structure

Each task file contains:

- **Priority**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- **Estimated Time**: Time to complete
- **Scope**: What the task covers
- **Current Issues**: Problems being solved
- **Implementation Tasks**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Success Criteria**: How to verify completion
- **Resources**: Links and references

## 🚀 How to Use These Tasks

1. **Start with HIGH priority tasks** - they address critical issues
2. **Work through MEDIUM priority tasks** - they improve code quality
3. **Complete tasks in order** - later tasks may depend on earlier ones
4. **Mark tasks as complete** - update the main analysis document
5. **Test thoroughly** - ensure no regressions

## ✅ Completion Checklist

After completing each task:

- [ ] All implementation steps completed
- [ ] Tests pass (`npm run test:run`)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles (`npm run type-check`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint:check`)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Update `../code-analysis-problems.md` after completing tasks to reflect current status.
